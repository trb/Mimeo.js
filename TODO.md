#List of things to do next:

## Server side example:
- create README.md to explain what example is for
- Focus this example solely on server-side/browser shared code
- Test with mocha


## Mimeo
- Investigate rollup for minification
- Figure out issues with jQuery for $http when POSTing an object with a json content type
