#List of things to do next:

## Server side example:
- switch to routes to actually display output
- use routes on cli to render html
- create README.md to explain what example is for
- Focus this example solely on server-side/browser shared code
- Test with mocha

## Todo example
- Merge into routing example

## Routing example
- Rename to "Todo"
- Use to showcase in-browser app
- Set up package.json and express to actually provide some routes to call
- Use kefir.js/rx.js and React for data/rendering
- Set up decent directory structure
- Make this an example for file structures, compontents, etc.
- Test with nightmare.js

## Mimeo
- Write tests for new module ($http, $window, etc)
- Write tests for non-covered code (use istanbul to find that)
- Remove babel presets once mimeo is installable via npm
- Investigate rollup for minification
